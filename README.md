##  Reason for Project
This project looks to take in historical data and use machine learning to realize market trends over a specific measure of time.

## The Struggle with linear regression   
We utilized linear regression for SPY stock price prediction, but the model encountered difficulty producing accurate results, as it was off by approximately $80 on average. This highlights the need to explore alternative machine learning models to enhance prediction accuracy.

##  Questions to answer
Based off of the predictions from our models we are looking to gain information for potential investment cycles by looking at:

GDP (Gross Domestic Product) over time
Federal Reserve interest rates over time
Unemployement rates over time
US dollar price index DXY
Market close trends by day
Communication Protocols
We will be using Slack for our frequent communication and arranging recurring Zoom meets for overall project build.
